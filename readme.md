## 🎯 About The Project

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, yet a significant gap exists between the development of advanced AI prediction models and their practical application in clinical settings. **CardioPredictNet AI** is a comprehensive project designed to bridge this gap.

This repository is structured as a professional, end-to-end machine learning solution, containing:
1.  **A Deep Learning Pipeline:** A modular, script-based workflow for training, evaluating, and saving a robust TensorFlow/Keras neural network for CVD risk prediction.
2.  **An Interactive Web Application:** A sophisticated and elegant Assessment Toolbuilt with Streamlit that loads the trained model, allowing users to perform real-time risk assessments through an intuitive interface.
3.  **Experimental Notebooks:** A dedicated space for the initial data exploration, model prototyping, and evaluation that informed the final production scripts.

The project emphasizes best practices in software engineering, including code modularity, environment reproducibility, and a clear separation between experimental and production code.

## ✨ Key Features

*   🧠 **Deep Learning Core:** A Keras/TensorFlow model designed to capture complex, non-linear relationships in patient data.
*   ✅ **Reliable Deployment:** The model is saved in the native Keras (`.keras`) format, ensuring seamless and error-free integration with the TensorFlow ecosystem.
*   📊 **Interactive & Elegant UI:** A beautiful and responsive Assessment Toolbuilt with Streamlit, featuring a custom dark theme for a professional user experience.
*   📈 **Rich Visualizations:** Real-time generation of insightful charts (gauges, metric cards) using Plotly for easy interpretation of results.
*   💡 **Personalized Recommendations:** The system provides actionable lifestyle advice based on the user's specific risk factors.
*   🔁 **Reproducible Environment:** A `requirements.txt` file allows for the exact recreation of the Python environment, guaranteeing that the code runs reliably.
*   📄 **Downloadable Reports:** Users can download a summary of their assessment for personal records or discussion with a healthcare professional.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   Git for cloning the repository.
*   A tool for creating virtual environments (like `venv`, which is built into Python).

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME].git
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```

2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
    This isolates the project's dependencies from your system's Python installation.
    ```bash
    # Create the environment
    python -m venv .venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On macOS / Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    # .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install All Dependencies:**
    This single command installs all the required packages.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage

With the setup complete, you can either train the model from scratch or run the pre-trained application.

### 1. Training the Model (Optional)

The repository includes a pre-trained model in the `/models` directory. To retrain the model yourself, run the training script from the root directory:

```bash
python src/train.py


This will execute the full pipeline: load data, train the model, run a detailed evaluation, and save the best model and scaler to the /models folder.
## 2. Launching the Streamlit Web Application
To start the interactive dashboard, run the following command from the root directory:

streamlit run src/app.py

Your browser should automatically open to the application's local URL! 🎉
